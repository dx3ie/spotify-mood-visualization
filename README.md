# visualizing music mood on spotify

i love spotify and i absolutely love listening to music.
this project explores how songs differ in mood and energy using spotify’s audio features, focusing on how music feels rather than popularity.

simple visualizations using:
- valence & energy  
- danceability & energy  
- mood differences across genres  

built with python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
